Modified version of MCMAS model checker.
Original version found at https://vas.doc.ic.ac.uk/software/mcmas/

This project can be built with a C++17 compiler using the "make" command in the command line.

This version of MCMAS can generate an emergence threshold of a given abstract model with meta data 
(from the transpiler https://github.com/jaspreetR/MCMAS-Extension) using the "-et <number>" option
where the given number is the temporal depth of the formula to be evaluated e.g. 
./mcmas -et 2 abstract_model.ispl
